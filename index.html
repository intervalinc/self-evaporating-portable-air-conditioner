<p>
While most portable AC units need to be drained frequently, the self evaporating portable air conditioner units do not, thanks to a clever design modification.

<br />
<br />
By re-evaporating the condensate that forms inside the unit during the air cooling process and exhausting the now gaseous moisture to the outside, there is little left to fill the container that is there for that purpose. 
<br />
<br />
This is well-worth the investment in a cooling appliance that eliminates its own internal condensate.
<br />
<br />
A self-evaporating AC, which evaporates its condensate, is a better choice than letting it drip into an endless-filling bucket, if your AC is old and free-standing.
<br />
<br />
Let's examine how these coolers eliminate the unwanted build-up of water in the container by sending it outside via its exhaust vent hose.
<br />
<br />
Before I do that, I will first show you how a standard, portable AC cools you in hot weather.
</p>
<h2>How an Air Conditioner Operates</h2>
<p>
It is important that you understand the inner workings of a portable AC. They perform a much needed function in hot weather so it pays to know what's going on inside the box.
<br />
<br />
I will show you how to get the cool air that you require during the heat.
</p>
<h3>Cooled Air</h3>
<p>
Air conditioners produce chilled water using a refrigeration process similar as your home fridge. It transfers heat, so one coil heats up and one coil cools.
<br />
<br />
The chilled coils cool the atmosphere and then the cold, blasted air is introduced to the room to cool them down. The heated coils make hot air and retain a lot of moisture. This moisture is then removed from the cold air.
</p>
<h3>Heated Air</h3>
<p>
<img src="img/portable-air-conditioner-unit.jpg" class="alignright" alt="portable air conditioner unit" title="Portable Air Conditioner Unit" />The hot, humid air escapes through pipes and conduits to the exterior. Not all of it is. Some moisture condenses in cold coils.
<br />
<br />
Air conditioners produce large drops of condensation that drip into a catchment basin at the base. It should be drained immediately it builds up.
<br />
<br />
Unintentional failure to empty a tray fully can cause the auto to turn off until it's empty. The auto shuts itself off.
</p>
<h2>A Portable Air Conditioner that Self-Evaporates</h2>
<p>
The use of excess condensation can enhance the cooling process of conventional air conditioners. By revaporating excess moisture, you can improve the cooling efficiency of cooling coils.
<br />
<br />
The heat from cooling coils is more effective at absorbing evaporated watervapor. Instead of being left to condense in a tray, it is circulated to the exterior by the exhaust conduits. This is the function of the self-evaporating conditioners.
<br />
<br />
The excess moisture is evaporated to the exterior.
</p>
<h2>The Benefits: Pros</h2>
<p>
One of its main advantages is the ability to use a device that doesn't require draining or emptying a water tray. Perhaps you've experienced this tedious chore.
<br />
<br />
This can be frustrating, and even dangerous. Some portable units may have to be lifted onto tables or boxes in order to let water drain into a bucket. The only way to move the water is through gravity.
<br />
<br />
AC units may also be affected by excessive water in the tanks. This results in no cooling. This will happen whenever the temperature is too high and uncomfortably hot.
<br />
<br />
Self-evaporating AC units however are not affected in this way.
<br />
<br />
One advantage of evaporating air conditioners that is often overlooked is their ability to cool down. They work better than traditional air conditioners. They use less energy cooling the same amount of air.
<br />
<br />
This could help reduce your household's energy consumption.
</p>
<h2>The Disadvantages: Cons</h2>
<p>
What could be considered a drawback of these air-cooling systems?
<br />
<br />
These units are expensive. A disadvantage can be the relatively small additional cost to purchase one of these units. It is quickly outweighed by lower running expenses due to greater efficiency and economics.
</p>
<h3>Excessive Humidity</h3>
<p>
It is possible for the unit to become damaged if it's placed in high humidity. In humid areas, the unit's ability is reduced to evaporate water.
<br />
<br />
A water tray is a way to store excess condensate when it is not possible to do so. Just like any other portable conditioner, this water tray should be empty after it fills up.
<br />
<br />
It is best to maintain a lower humidity in order to prevent this. It is best to avoid steam emitted from hot tubs, hot showers, or large boiling water in unventilated kitchens.
<br />
<br />
Regular fans are suitable for humid areas in order to help to reduce humidity. The fan will move the moist air through a vent, before the humidity is addressed by the air conditioner.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
A portable air conditioner is a unit that cools you in areas where there may not be a window or AC.
<br />
<br />
To maximize efficiency and economics, it's a sound investment to buy a self-evaporating portable conditioning unit with dual hose design.
<br />
<br />
Saving you extra work and hassle by not needing to drain or empty a portable cooler can be a major help in today's busy lifestyles. The less you need to do, the better!
<br />
<br />
A portable self evaporating air conditioner (see: <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/self-evaporating-portable-air-conditioner/index.html">here</a> for more info) is the perfect labor saver that will still keep you cool in summer and eliminate a particularly unwanted chore in the process.
